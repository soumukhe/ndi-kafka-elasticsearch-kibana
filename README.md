# ndi-kafka-elasticsearch-kibana

This is basically the Confluent docker code which has been slightly modified for the purpose of POC usage for Nexus Dashboard Insights Kafka Usage.
With this you can quickly configure your Kafka Producer on NDI to export to the Kafka Consumer running on a docker conatiner and then use Kafka Connect
pipeline so the data is available in elasticsearch for analysis and viewing.  You can then also use Kibana for nice graphs/charts visualizations.

Confluent documentation can be found at: https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/platform.html
